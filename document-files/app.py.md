Flask application set up with functionalities for user authentication, note-taking, image uploading, and user management. Here are a few points I noticed:

1. **File Uploads**: You're using Flask to handle file uploads, which is great. You've implemented a function `FUN_upload_image` to handle the image upload process, including checking file extensions, securing filenames, and saving files to the server.

2. **Security**: You're using `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` to ensure that the filenames are safe and secure. This is important to prevent directory traversal attacks.

3. **Error Handling**: You've implemented error handling for various HTTP error codes (`401`, `403`, `404`, `405`, `413`). This is good practice for improving the user experience and handling unexpected situations gracefully.

4. **User Management**: You have functionalities for user login, logout, and user administration (`/admin/`). You're also ensuring that only the admin can perform certain actions like adding or deleting users.

5. **Database Operations**: You're interacting with a database (assuming it's SQLAlchemy) for various operations like storing user information, notes, and images. This is essential for persisting data across sessions.

6. **Session Management**: You're using Flask's session management to keep track of the current user's session, which is necessary for maintaining user state across multiple HTTP requests.

7. **Routes**: Your application has defined routes for different functionalities like login, logout, uploading images, writing notes, etc. Each route corresponds to a specific action or page within the application.

8. **Template Rendering**: You're using Jinja2 templates (`render_template`) to render HTML pages. This allows you to dynamically generate HTML content based on data from the server.

Overall, your Flask application looks well-structured and covers a range of functionalities commonly found in web applications.
